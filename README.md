# Order Management Back-end

## Goals
- Create a REST API to communicate to my MongoDB database for user and order data
- Flesh out all endpoints needed to build my full-stack web application
- Learn more about Node, Express, MongoDB, and JSON Web Tokens

## Where To Find
- The full-stack web application will be built in the coming weeks. Once that is built, it will be hosted and I will link it here
